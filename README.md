# Python_IPNneurons_nicotine

This repository contains the code for the project **Python_IPNneurons_classifications**, developped during a collaboration with 
two prestigious Neuroscience laboratories from New-York City (NY, USA) : The Rockefeller University and the Mont-Sinai.   

The goal of this project is to Classify brains neurons based on their responses to pharmacological drugs (oxycodone and nicotine). 
The Neuronal activity in quantify using Action potential rate ("AP rate" or "spiking rate") express in Hertz (Hz) . 
The data have been pre-processed and AP have been sorted using PLEXON SORTER (software from PLEXON company), by me Julien Catanese, and store in a nex5 format. 
The nex5 files are transform into a python readable format. 

This project was developed by the following team of datasceintist:

- Julien Catanese (me)  ([LinkedIn] https://www.linkedin.com/in/julien-catanese-57137232/)
- Adam Catto            ([LinkedIn] https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamcatto/)


Analysis is currently beeing done. 

Soon you will be able to browse and run the notebooks. 

You will need to install the dependencies (in a dedicated environment) :


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
